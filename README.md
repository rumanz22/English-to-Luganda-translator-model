# English-to-Luganda-translator-model
Overview of the Project: English to Luganda Translator

The English to Luganda Translator is a machine translation application designed to bridge the gap between English and Luganda, a widely spoken language in Uganda. It leverages the power of the MarianMT model by Hugging Face, a state-of-the-art neural machine translation framework, to provide accurate and context-aware translations. This project aims to showcase how AI can facilitate communication and preserve cultural heritage through language technology.

Key Objectives:

Build an efficient translation system for English to Luganda.

Enable interactive demonstrations for both technical and non-technical users.

Provide an intuitive, user-friendly interface powered by Gradio.

Process of Creating the Project

Research and Planning Identified Problem: A lack of accessible tools for translating English to Luganda. Solution: Use the pre-trained MarianMT model from Hugging Face, specifically fine-tuned for English-to-Luganda translation.

Dataset Preparation Source Data: A dataset (Luganda.csv) containing English sentences and their corresponding Luganda translations was used.

Preprocessing: Checked for missing values. Selected relevant columns (English and Luganda). Renamed columns for consistency (source for English, target for Luganda).

Model Setup Model Selection: The MarianMT model (Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-lg) was chosen for its effectiveness in low-resource language translation.
Tokenizer and Model Loading: Tokenizer prepares input sentences for the model. MarianMT generates translations based on trained parameters.

Application Development Gradio Interface: Designed a web-based interface that: Accepts English input for translation. Displays the Luganda translation output. Provides sample translations using examples from the dataset.

Evaluation Testing: Sampled sentences from the dataset to compare model predictions with reference translations (ground truth). Quality Assessment: Used BLEU scores to evaluate translation accuracy and identify areas for improvement.

Deployment The project is deployed locally and can be hosted online using platforms like Hugging Face Spaces, Streamlit Cloud, or AWS.

Manual: How It Works

Using the Translator

Access the Interface:

Open the application in your browser (a link or local IP will be provided).

Input English Sentence: Type an English sentence into the text box (e.g., "How are you?").

Get Translation: Click the "Translate" button to receive the Luganda translation. Example: Input: "How are you?" Output: "Oli otya?"

Exploring Example Translations Navigate to the "Example Translations" tab. Use the slider to select an example from the dataset. Click "Show Example" to display:

Input Sentence (English): From the dataset.

Predicted Translation (Luganda): Generated by the model.

Ground Truth (Luganda): Correct translation from the dataset. This allows you to compare the model's performance with the reference translations.

Technical Details Model: Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-lg from Hugging Face.

Frameworks: PyTorch, Transformers, Gradio.

Dataset: A CSV file of English and Luganda sentence pairs.

Metrics: BLEU score for translation accuracy.

Target Audience This project is designed for:

Linguists: To showcase how AI can help preserve and promote underrepresented languages.

Developers: To demonstrate machine translation workflows using Hugging Face.

General Users: To provide a practical translation tool for everyday communication.

Future Enhancements

Fine-tuning the model with a larger, domain-specific dataset.

Expanding the interface to support Luganda-to-English translation.

Adding speech input and output for enhanced accessibility.

This project highlights the power of AI in bridging linguistic gaps and fostering inclusivity in communication. Try it out to explore how AI is revolutionizing language technology!
